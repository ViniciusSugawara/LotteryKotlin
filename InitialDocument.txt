System requirements: LotteryKotlin
What is asked:
 System must be able to create a random lottery draw
 System must be able to add players
 System must be able to draw random numbers for players
 System must be able to determine if someone won
 
 A game is worth $6
 The number limit per game is 6 numbers (Max value being 60)
 
Classes that will be used:
 Player (Has name, and a ticket)
 Ticket (Has six random numbers)
 Randomizer (Returns an array of random numbers, based on a limit of draws and max value)
 Verifier (Verifies if the numbers randomized coincide with the player ticket)
 Raffle (Makes the interaction happen between all classes)
 Game (Defines the rules that a game will follow, example: Defines the limit of numbers being drawn, or the highest value possible, or the value of each game)
 
Main idea: Have a menu interface that selects a determined type of game.
 Then, it will be possible to add players, with tickets and numbers, determined by the game selected. For each ticket, there will be a price.
 Then, it will be possible to create a raffle, if there is one or more players.
 After the raffle happens, the system verifies if a ticket has won, and will return the corresponding player with the prize pool.
 
 
Additional implementation ideas:
	Have a graphic interface for all the things that happen during the program execution
	Have a repository that saves all the raffles that happened
